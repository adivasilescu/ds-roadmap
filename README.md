**Steps:**
**1. Python for Data Science, AI and Development - Coursera  (Week 1-4)**

Notes Week 2:
Lists
- index = 0, 1 ,2 (the number in a list)
- list: L = ["The Bodyguard", 7.0, 1992] - lists are in [].
- lists can be .extend (multiple new elements), .append (one new element), .split,
  copied { a = [1.2] b = a print ('a:', a) }; delete { del (A[-1]) }

Tuplets: In Python, there are different data types: String, Integer, and Float. These data types can all be contained in a tuple 
- tuple1 = ("disco",10,1.2 )
- Tuplests can be: sliced (tuple2[0:2]  ;   concatenated tuple2 = tuple1 + ("hard rock", 10)   ;  obtain len  ; sorted ; nested in brackets ;
